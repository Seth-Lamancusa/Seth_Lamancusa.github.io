					<p><b>Seth Lamancusa</b> (Born October 7, 2002) is a Data Analytics major attending The Ohio State
						University pursuing a Cognitive Science minor. Interests include
						Artificial Intelligence (AI),
						philosophy, art, and the Oxford comma.</p>
					<p>This page is simultaneously a personal catalogue and a professional
						development tool. I want a platform on which to showcase my projects, accomplishments,
						and experience. I aim to use this as a living
						outlet for my own passions, interests, and personal growth. I didn't want just another Bootstrap
						template, and I wanted to get some experience with HTML and CSS, so I landed on making a
						Wikipedia
						clone. Unfortunately, Wikipedia overhauled their frontend for the first time in a decade
						just months after I made it. C'est la vie.</p>
					<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Northeast Ohio. I always had an affinity for math
						and coding. Following a brief but enthusiastic gamedev phase during junior high I leaned into
						marching band and
						drum corps, occupying most of my time and energy during high school. During my Junior and
						Senior years I discovered a fascination with AI. It appealed to both my technical and
						philosophical faculties, and has become something of an obsession since then.
					</p>
					<p>During college, I've discovered the rich and encompassing field of Cognitive Science (of which AI
						is
						a component) and come a
						long way toward understanding the state of the various constituent academic fields and of the
						technological space. I'm currently working as a Research Assistant in <a
							href="https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/">Dr. Julie Golomb's Vision
							and Cognitive Neuroscience lab</a> and am learning as much as I can about AI on my own time.
						I'm excited to continue to narrow down my area of interest and get some tangible experience with
						AI systems.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<h3>High School</h3>
					<p>I attended Stow-Munroe Falls High School for four years. Involved with Speech and Debate,
						Marching Band, Concert Band, and co-founding
						our very own Esports team, I did my best to remain active in our community while leaning into
						those extracurriculars which inspired a unique passion.</p>
					<p>As far as school work was concerned, I challenged myself to maintain a high level of academic
						achievement. I took a total of 8 college-level AP
						courses thoughout my time in high school, none of which resulted in test scores lower than 4.
						I engaged especially with AP English Literature and Composition and AP English Language and
						Composition, but skipped AP Psychology to get ahead on college GE's with AP Micro and
						Macroeconomics. In a twist of fate, I would wind up pursuing a Cognitive Science minor after
						graduating high school, and neither of those two economics classes would be eligible for
						transfer credit.</p>
					<h3>College</h3>
					<p>My college experience has been as transformative as expected, and I learn more every day (and
						not just about the subjects for which I'm taking classes). But, seeing as the classes are kind
						of the point, here's some tables.</p>

					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<h3>Dunkin': Crew Member, August 2019 - February 2021</h3>
					<p>I woked part time at Dunkin for several years in high school. It was fast-paced work and as a
						crew
						member, I was responsible for working the register, drive-thru, drink and sandwich stations,
						and completing the cleaning checklist.</p>
					<h3>The Ohio State University: Software 1 Grader, January 2022 - May 2022</h3>
					<p>During the spring semester of my Freshman year, I worked part time as a grader for Software 1,
						which I had taken the semester prior. I was offered the role for my exemplary performance in the
						course and working the position was highly beneficial for my own understanding of the course
						concepts: namely the basics of Java, and implementations of various common data structures and
						algorithms.</p>
					<h3>The Ohio State University: Research Assistant, June 2023 - present</h3>
					<p>Over the summer and throughout this semester, I've worked part time in <a
							href="https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/">Dr. Julie Golomb's Vision
							and Cognitive Neuroscience lab</a>. I'm responsible for running subjects for my
						mentor's experiment, attending lab meetings, and reading relevant literature. I frequently speak
						with my mentor regarding her experimental design and data processing techniques. I've also been
						exposed to a lot of MATLAB and statistical methodology.</p>
					<p>The reason I applied for and took this position was for its adjacency to cognitive science. Since
						taking it, I've realized that my interests lie more in the realm of CS, AI, and philosophy than
						they do in behavioral psychology, but I don't regret a minute I've spent with Dr. Golomb and her
						team. It has been a really enriching experience to watch how research is done up close and get
						hands-on with the methodology and with the data.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="hobbies">
					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p>I've taken to a diverse assortment of hobbies over the years, including sports, musical
						instruments, video games, skills, and intellectual pursuits. Perhaps more than anything else at
						all, I love the process of improving at
						something. This was was part of the motivation behind
						<a href="https://github.com/Seth-Lamancusa/26quick">26quick</a>. I also can't imagine this
						interest
						in learning is unrelated to my interest in machine learning. Here are some of the hobbies
						to which I've
						dedicated my time.
					</p>
					<h3 id="percussion">Percussion</h3>
					<div class="imgcontainer" id="matrix_con">
						<img alt="Picture of me playing in Matrix A finals" id="matrix" src="images/Matrix.jpg">
						<p>Me playing in Matrix A final run</p>
					</div>
					<p>The hobby, and singular pursuit to which I have undoubtedly dedicated the most time is that of
						percussion. I picked up a pair of sticks for the first time in 5th grade and participated in my
						middle schools'
						concert band programs throughout 8th grade. The advent of marching band in high school and the
						mentorship of an older student who was involved with independent drum corps and indoor programs
						(thanks Alex) accelerated the growth of my passion for the sport of marching percussion, while
						experimenting with increasingly sophisticated keyboard percussion techniques inspired a real
						love for the musicality of concert and solo percussion.</p>
					<p>Fulfilling the roles of squad leader and section leader at my high school for multiple years and
						participating in <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1au-fFfoV4r2pLQbXxC7RK4KT-1ckxt6N/view?usp=sharing"
							target="blank">WGI's Matrix A 2021</a> indoor group, then going on to prepare to tryout for
						The Best Damn Band In The Land (TBDBITL) two years running, participating in the university's
						athletic band my Freshman year and practicing thousands of hours besides, it's safe to say that
						among the projects and skills I've developed, and among the passions I've cultivated, percussion
						outranks the rest.</p>
					<p>Despite this, at the end of the summer before my Sophomore year, a week before tryouts and
						after having worked all summer to prepare, I decided against trying out. The words of Paul
						Morphy echoed in my mind: <span class="quote">"The ability to play chess is the sign of a
							gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life."</span>. My
						interest in AI had become undeniable and I knew just how time consuming being a member of
						TBDBITL is.
						If I were to have continued with marching band, I would have had hundreds of hours fewer to
						dedicate to developing my technical skillset. So I hung up my garment bag for the last time and
						haven't regretted it once.
					</p>
					<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
					<p>It all started with block coding in my seventh grade STEM class. I liked Scratch, and I
						liked the idea of using gamedev as a medium through which to realize my ideas, so in eighth
						grade when
						presented with the opportunity to pursue whatever type of project I desired as part of a
						once-weekly
						"genius hour" segment of my language arts class, I chose to make a <a
							href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/103465532/" target="blank">game</a> using Scratch.
						After that, I experimented with Unity for awhile before my focus was more or less
						redirected to drumline, and my interest in gamedev transformed into a more holistic interest in
						software, which I developed through participation in a career program at my high school, through
						which I learned the basics of Java, SQL, and HTML/CSS/JS.
					</p>
					<p>
						I dabbled with coding throughout high school but it's only through formal education and
						abandoning
						drumming that I've become really comfortable with languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
						There are a number of projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Seth-Lamancusa">GitHub</a>
						which reflect my interest in software better than I could convey in words here. I look forward
						to
						continuing to learn to effectively use software as a tool to realize my ideas.
					</p>
					<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
					<p>Over the past couple of years, I've rediscovered a love of books that lay dormant for a long
						time. I'm much more
						interested in nonfiction than I was in gradeschool, and my reading list is longer than ever.
						Among my favorite authors today are Carl Sagan and Sean Carroll, and I've come to realize the
						power of literature in a way that never stuck with me when I was young. For my "read",
						"currently reading", and "to read" lists, as well as to read the reviews I've written of books
						I've read recently, visit the library panel of this website or view my <a
