					<p><b>Seth Lamancusa</b> (Born October 7, 2002) is a Data Analytics major attending The Ohio State
						University pursuing a Cognitive Science minor. Interests include AI research, music, theoretical
						physics, and coming up with ideas I have no intention of executing. My high school English
						teachers
						may not approve of the mid-sentence tense change but the third-person thing felt a bit
						narcissistic
						for me even given the nature of this whole page.</p>
					<p>And what is the nature of this page? It's simultaneously personal catalogue and professional
						development tool. I want a platform on which to showcase my projects, accomplishments, thoughts,
						and personal developments. Instead of some generic Bootstrap template with the same material as
						every other professional development-oriented personal website, I aim to use this as a living
						outlet for my own passions, projects, and personal developments. </p>
					<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Northeast Ohio, opportunity abound. I always had an affinity for math
						and
						logic which could be why I gravitated to coding so strongly when I was introduced to Scratch in
						the
						7th grade. Following a brief but enthusiastic gamedev phase I leaned into marching band and
						drum corps, occupying much of my high school mental and temporal capital. During my Junior and
						Senior years I discovered a fascination with artificial intelligence. It appealed to my
						philosophical nature and something felt undeniably profound about understanding the nature of
						consciousness. <span class="quote">"We aren't humans experiencing the universe, but the universe
							experiencing

							Alan Watts, maybe.</span> Understanding how humans understand the universe seems integral to
						understanding

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p class="sdate">August 7, 2022</p>
					<p>I attended Stow-Munroe Falls High School for four years to round off my preundergraduate
						education. Involved with Speech and Debate, Marching Band, Concert Band, and co-founding
						our very own Esports team, I did my best to remain active in our community while leaning into
						those extracurriculars which inspired a unique passion.</p>
					<p>As far as school work was concerned, I challenged myself to maintain the level of academic
						proficiency I had exemplified in elementary school. Unfortunately the subject matter had moved
						on from arithmetic and the solar system (though I would notably maintain an avid interest in
						both math and space into my adult life). Regardless, I took a total of 8 college-level AP
						courses thoughout my time in high school, none of which resulted in test scores lower than 4.
						I engaged especially with AP English Literature and Composition and AP English Language and
						Composition, but skipped AP Psychology to get ahead on college GE's with AP Micro and
						Macroeconomics. In a twist of fate, I would wind up pursuing a Cognitive Science minor after
						graduating high school, and neither of those two economics classes would be eligible for
						transfer credit.
						Ha!</p>

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p class="sdate">October 15, 2022</p>
					<p>Characteristic of my youth moreso than any individual pursuit was a constant juggling of
						different interests and hobbies (and I don't mean literal juggling, though this was in fact one
						of
						them). From various video games to speed cubing to art to lucid dreaming to
						speedrunning these same games, to various sports, chess, lifting, and finally percussion
						and computer science, I always
						enjoyed more than the thing itself, getting better at a thing. Watching my free throw get more
						consistent, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxEHxrSZHk0" target="blank">Celeste
							Classic time</a> get lower, my art look better, or my playing sound cleaner
						were different mediums through which I was experiencing the same love of learning. Video games
						appealed especially to this lust for progress; filling out a Minecraft world over the course of
						months of planning and resource-gathering or watching my rank icon roll over from gold to
						platinum were satisfying for the same reason drawing and juggling were. The progress, physical
						or skill-related, validated the time and energy committed to the project or skill.
					</p>
					<p>I've noticed over the past few years an erring away from this formulaic recycling of hobbies.
						While I will never cease to enjoy air-dribbling in Rocket League or finding an especially clever
						tactic in Chess, these pursuits eventually felt too narrow. <span class="quote">"The ability to
							play chess is the
							sign of a gentleman. The ability to play chess well is the sign of a wasted life." - Paul
							Morphy (Chess Grandmaster).</span> I knew I was capable of great
						organization, imagination, and discipline and I felt the need to apply this proficiency to
						something profound
						and unique. Since then I've found myself increasingly excited by certain academic disciplines,
						especially history and physics, and uniquely impassioned by the subject of cognition, especially
						human and artificial. These passions satisfy the same desire for proficiency as did video games
						and sports, but without their limited scope. It took my realizing that learning information is
						not so different to learning a
						skill to discover a real passion for knowledge. It isn't a passion for memorization, but for
						the forming of associations between beliefs I hold and ideas to which I'm being introduced for
						the
						first time. And in this way, learning becomes organic and natural instead of
						formulaic and repetitive. It's a mentality that fosters casual curiosity but doesn't necessitate
						rigourous study. I'll never stop enjoying video games for their simplicity and their limited
						scope, but there's a much grander game that we're all playing. Boundless complexity and a
						virtually infinite skill ceiling characterize the game we call life, and if I had to pick a
						hobby to spend the rest of my time exploring, it'd be that one.</p>
					<h3 id="percussion">Percussion</h3>
					<p>The hobby, and singular pursuit to which I have undoubtedly dedicated the most time is that of
						percussion. It started in 5th grade, at which point I decided trumpet just wasn't loud enough
						for me. I picked up a pair of sticks for the first time and participated in my middle schools'
						concert band programs throughout 8th grade. The advent of marching band in high school and the
						mentorship of an older student who was involved with independent drum corps and indoor programs
						(thanks Alex) accelerated the growth of my passion for the sport of marching percussion, while
						experimenting with increasingly sophisticated keyboard percussion techniques inspired a real
						love for the musicality of concert and solo percussion.</p>
					<p>Fulfilling the roles of squad leader and section leader at my high school for multiple years and
						participating in <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1au-fFfoV4r2pLQbXxC7RK4KT-1ckxt6N/view?usp=sharing"
							target="blank">WGI's Matrix A 2021</a> indoor group, then going on to prepare to tryout for
						The
						Best Damn Band In The Land (TBDBITL) two years running, participating in the university's
						athletic band my
						Freshman year and practicing thousands of hours besides any of these, it's safe to say that
						among the
						projects and skills I've developed, and among the passions I've cultivated, percussion
						outranks
						the rest. </p>
					<p>Notably, however, and despite preparing to try out for TBDBITL twice now, I have no intention of
						going for a third round. In fact, I specify "...prepared to try out..." instead of "...tried
						out..."
						for a reason. At the end of the summer before my Sophomore year, a week before tryouts and after
						having worked all summer to prepare, I decided against trying out. I still can't typically
						convince perople what I did was reasonable given the reputation the band has and my generous
						odds of making it, but I'll do what I can to contextualize the dramatic shift away
						from the passion which inspired such a unique devotion in high school. There was simply another
						group of passions which overtook band: artificial intelligence, the general formalization of
						cognition, and computer
						science/software development as a tool. Not participating in any type of band-related
						extracurricular Spring semester of my Freshman year probably played a role in my willingness to
						formally abandon the hobby at the end of the summer: I learned I could enjoy life just as much,
						if not more without band. Between the classes I took and the ideas for software-related projects
						I had,
						I became so
						excited for my future in the context of computer science that I was willing to abandon my sunk
						costs and dive headfirst into the active realization of some of the ideas I had had for so long.
					</p>
					<h3 id="gamedev">Gamedev</h3>
					<p>Despite never having completed an original project of significance, gamedev felt important to
						include in any personal list
						of hobbies on account of the fact that it truly teed up my interest in software and computer
						science. It all started with block coding in my seventh grade STEM class. I liked Scratch, and I
						liked the idea of using it to realize my ideas for video games, so in eighth grade when
						presented with the opportunity to pursue whatever type of project I desired as part of a
						once-weekly
						"genius hour" segment of my language arts class, I chose to make a <a
							href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/103465532/" target="blank">game</a> using Scratch.
						After that, I experimented with Unity for awhile before my focus was more or less
						redirected to drumline. I would still love to learn Unity or Unreal thoroughly in the future, as
						there are a number of ideas I have for unique video games, but for now I'll content myself with
						gamedev as a casual interest and the inspiration for <a href="https://26quick.com"

							<p><a href="https://26quick.com/">26quick</a> is a data science-oriented project designed to
								practice data collection,
								organization,
								analysis, and visulaization
								on a medium-sized relational database, facilitating a familiarity with the entire data
								pipeline (including database structure and design). Also promotes a broad understanding
								of full-stack responsive web development and a few ubiquitous web technologies. Broadly,
								the idea is to analyze trends in how people aquire skills learned by rote. What are
								ideal values for practice parameters to maximize improvement, such as practice session
								regularity,
								duration, and warm-up time required? The necessity to store keystroke information for
								every player's every repetition will itself necessitate proficiency in data
								organization, analytics, and visualization given the sheer scale of data available.</p>

						<h2>Drumline Analysis</h2>
						<div>
							<img src="images/project_icons/drumline_anal_icon.png" alt="Drumline analysis icon">
							<p>Currently but a <a href="https://github.com/Seth-Lamancusa/drumline-analysis">simple
									Python script</a>, the potential for this particular project is
								exiting. Given the simplicity of marching snare drum as an instrument, computational
								analysis of a waveform proves a relatively simple challenge, enabling specific
								quantitative insights
								related to volume consistency and rhythmic accuracy. The future of the project will
								emphasize
								streamlining the user/software loop via
								the development of a friendly GUI, the automatic conversion of uploaded sheet music, and
								the inclusion of manual peak detection in the event of difficult edge cases.</p>

						<h2>Modelling Cognition</h2>
						<div>
							<img src="" alt="">
							<p>I love the idea of modelling different components of human cognition computationally.
								Just as neural networks functionally replicate the brain's ability to learn certain
								skills,
								I believe the brain's abilities to categorize continuous input, reason binarily on
								adaptive datapoints, and express/interpret information via natural language are
								replicatable computationally and
								that constructing and implementing logical
								models of these abilities can lend insight into human cognition's apparent
								sophistication. My only actual implementation of this idea is a <a
									href="https://github.com/Seth-Lamancusa/inferring_continuity">python script</a>
								which
								attempts to infer the continuous vector space in which data points can exist based on
								the discrete categories into which we place them.</p>
